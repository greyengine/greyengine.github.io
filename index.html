            <b>About</b><br>
            the grey engine is a game engine that is written in C++ using the <b><a class="link" href="./rey">rey</a></b> framework. 
            It was created to be as simple as possible, but still be able to do almost anything you could do with OpenGL or another game engine.
            It also is incredibly easy to create your own game using the grey engine. It will also be way faster and more efficient on the users CPU and GPU than other game engines.
