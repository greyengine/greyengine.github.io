            <b>About</b><br>
            rey is a collection of modules designed to make game creation as easy as possible. 
            Each module is designed to have extremely simple syntax while still giving you full 
            control and allowing you to do whatever you want. And since each module works on 
            their own, it's easy to import into other projects. All modules are programmed in C, 
            making it able to run on a lot of platforms and be blazingly fast while at it. Used
            in the creation of <b><a class="link" href="../simple-shapes">simple shapes</a></b>.

            grey is the main module of rey, handling graphics, It uses OpenGL, meaning that it's 
            multi-platform, meaning that the code you write will work on Windows, Mac, Linux and 
            more. Despite the fact that you're able too do pretty much anything you can do with 
            OpenGL using grey, it's still simple to write and understand. And unlike a lot of other 
            graphics libraries, grey uses batch calls, meaning that the object drawn onto the 
            screen goes to the GPU and back as fast as possible, so it is possible for even the 
            worst PCs to draw hundreds of thousands of squares without breaking a sweat.
